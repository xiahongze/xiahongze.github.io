Welcome to my blog! Hurrah!

I like reading blogs but rarely thought about writing them, mainly because life is so packed with random stuff and also because my kids keep me busy at home. However, a terrrible bike accident last week had changed my daily life quite drastically (hopefully it is just short-term). Now I have plenty of spare time to kill off and blogging seems to be a viable option among other things, like reading and resting.

Blogging could help me organise my thoughts and potentially be a good communication mean to the outside world. If any posts in this site are useful to anyone in any way, I'd be happy and happier if the audience would let me know of.

Thanks for reading.
